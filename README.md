# Person-detection-system

## Overview

This project involves the development of a person detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The process includes data generation, annotation, feature extraction, training of the CNN model, and verification. The data for this project was generated by splitting video footage into individual images of single persons, which were then used to create a robust detection system.

## Project Structure

- `data/`
  - `generated_data/`: Contains folders with images of single persons split from videos.
  - `annotations/`: Contains annotated data for training the CNN model.
- `features/`
  - `extracted_features.npy`: Contains extracted features for training the CNN model.
- `model/`
  - `trained_model.h5`: Contains the trained CNN model.
- `scripts/`
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Script for preprocessing the data (e.g., splitting video, annotation).
  - `feature_extraction.py`: Script for feature extraction.
  - `train_cnn.py`: Script for training the CNN model.
  - `verify_model.py`: Script for verifying the trained model.

## Data Generation

1. **Video Splitting**: Videos were split into individual frames, with each frames representing a single person.
2. **Folder Structure**: Each personâ€™s images were organized into separate folders named after the person.

## Annotation

The generated images were annotated to create a dataset suitable for training the CNN. Annotation files are stored in the `annotations/` directory.

## Feature Extraction

Features were extracted from the annotated images and saved in `.npy` format. The extracted features are used for training the CNN model.

## Training the CNN

The CNN model was trained using the extracted features. The training process involves:
- Loading the annotated data and extracted features.
- Configuring the CNN architecture.
- Training the model and saving it in the `model/` directory.

## Verification

The trained CNN model was verified using a separate validation dataset to ensure its performance. Verification scripts are included in the `scripts/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Run `scripts/data_preprocessing.py` to prepare the dataset.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Run `scripts/feature_extraction.py` to extract features from the data.
3. **Model Training**: Run `scripts/train_cnn.py` to train the CNN model.
4. **Model Verification**: Run `scripts/verify_model.py` to verify the trained model.
